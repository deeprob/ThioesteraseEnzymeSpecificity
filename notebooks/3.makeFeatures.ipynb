    "iFeature was used to generate 21 feature files. It works with the same conda environment defined for our ML tool. We forked the iFeature directory from the original github repo [link] and wrote three bash scripts to generate feature vectors for our enzymes. The bash scripts are given in the forked version of our iFeature repo: [link]. Please note that for the bash scripts to work, the iFeature folder must be in the same directory as the Thioesterase folder. \n",

    "3. getPSSMprofile.sh -  for this to work, blastp must be on path. It has two arguments, input_fasta_file_path and output_directory_to_store_files.
